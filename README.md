## Project 1 - NBA Stats: Visualizing the Last 10 Years and Predicting Future Points
- Tools used: Python, Excel, Power BI
- Developed a dynamic, interactive dashboard that allows users to select a player from the previous 10 seasons and see their stats, broken down by season and/or overall. Users can filter by the Regular Season and Playoffs as well.
- Data was scraped from NBA.com using Python and was directly saved to an Excel file. The Excel file was then linked to Power BI to investigate the data and create insights into the dataset.
