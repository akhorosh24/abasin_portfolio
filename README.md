## [Project 1 - NBA Stats: Visualizing the Last 10 Years and Predicting Future Points](https://github.com/akhorosh24/abasin_portfolio/tree/main/NBA%20Dashboard)
- Tools used: Python, Excel, Power BI
- Developed a dynamic, interactive dashboard that allows users to select a player from the previous 10 seasons and see their stats. Users can filter by year and season type (Regular Season and Playoffs) as well.
- Data was scraped from NBA.com using Python and was directly saved to an Excel file. The Excel file was then linked to Power BI to investigate the data and create insights into the dataset.
- Predictive Modeling: Using Linear Regression, users are able to set a value for minutes played and estimate the average number of points per game a player is predicted to score, using the historical data from the previous 10 seasons and assuming a linear relationship between points and minutes.
